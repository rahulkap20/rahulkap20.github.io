            <h3><a href="https://www.bbdsoftware.com/">BBD</a> (1 Year, 5 Months)</h3>
            <p>BBD is a multinational IT consulting firm, tasked with managing projects for a varied clientele across
                the logistics, finance, insurance, and telecommunications sectors. With offices situated in South

            <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
            <p>January 2024 - Present</p>
            <p>At present, the bulk of my time is dedicated to the same client software with which I engaged last year
                concurrently with my graduate program. This client relies on a tailored web application for logistics
                management, for which we oversee the entire technological infrastructure. The frontend is powered by
                <b>Angular with Typescript</b>, while the backend leverages <b>.NET/C#</b> in conjunction with a
                <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b>
                database. Hosting is facilitated within the <b>AWS cloud</b> environment. Furthermore, the client
                operates
                across multiple locations, each equipped with Windows PCs. We've developed an application using
                <b>WPF</b> that
                seamlessly integrates with the logistics system. This ongoing project has afforded me invaluable
                insights into full-stack development and managing integration across diverse software components.

            <p>January 2023 - December 2023</p>
            <p>During my first year, I took part in a graduate program which proved to be immensely enriching.
                It offered exposure to a diverse array of programming languages and frameworks. Moreover, it
                improved my teamwork skills, as well as my ability to work under pressure with stringent
                deadlines. The curriculum of the graduate program encompassed many subjects, including <b>databases
                    (both relational and non-relational), C#, Java, web development, security protocols, testing
                    methodologies, design patterns, and data science</b>. Additionally, I worked with a client in
                conjunction with the grad program, where I worked on a web application for logistics management,

            <h4><b>MSc Computer Science</b> <i>(Pass with distinction)</i>, <a href="https://www.up.ac.za">University of
                    Pretoria</a></h4>
            <p>Class of 2023</p>
            <p>My master's degree focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AL/ML). I authored a
                dissertation where I made use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and
                Generic Programming (GP) to automate the design process of a convolutional neural network (CNN).
                Additionally, I introduced a variant of Genetic Programming known as Structure-based Genetic Programming
                (SBGP), which proved to be more effective for the same task, surpassing both GAs and traditional GP.
                Fortunately, this research led to the publication of one conference paper and one journal article. I owe
                much of my success to my supervisor, Prof. Nelishia Pillay, whose invaluable guidance contributed
                significantly to achieving these results. Prof. Pillay also co-authored the paper and article: </p>

            <p>Class of 2021</p>
            <p>My honour's degree served to consolidate and enhance my foundational knowledge in computer science and
                software engineering acquired during my undergraduate studies. The subjects I pursued included
                Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, Data Mining, Digital Forensics, and Computer and Information
                Security. As part of the curriculum, I undertook a research project from a range of topics. I researched
                machine translation using transformer models, focusing on developing a miniature translation program
                capable of translating English into Afrikaans and isiZulu. This involved making use of publicly
                accessible parallel corpora (datasets) to train the translation program.</p>

            <h4><b>BSc Computer Science</b>, University of Pretoria</h4>
            <p>Class of 2020</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate degree, I had the privilege of learning a multitude of skills and techniques from
                exceptionally smart teachers. In my final year, I took subjects such as Software Engineering,
                Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks, and Database Systems. Additionally, I focused on analytical
                subjects like Stochastic Processes, Multivariate Analysis, and Time-Series Analysis. </p>
            <p>As part of my degree requirements, I undertook a final year project that required me, as part of a team,
                to build a piece of software for a corporate client. I was the team leader, and together, my team and I
                built a web application using Reinforcement Learning (an AI technique that allows a program to adjust
                its parameters over time given new information, i.e., learn over time) to control traffic lights in a
                simulated environment. This environment was based on a real stretch of road with multiple intersections.
                Data, such as car numbers, car types, and frequency of cars during regular vs. peak hours, was collected
                for initial training and randomly generated thereafter. This application, called LightBot, was
                well-received by our lecturers, earning me a distinction for the course.</p>

            <p>In my earlier
                years, I concentrated on core computer science principles such as data structures and algorithms,
                concurrent programming, and computer organization and architecture, which provided me with a solid
                foundation. In my first year, I also took physics and business management as minors.</p>

            <p>I graduated from high school with seven distinctions and received academic honors in my final year. I
                took the following subjects in high school: English Home Language, Afrikaans First Additional Language,
                Mathematics, AP Mathematics, Information Technology (Computer Programming), Life Sciences (Biology),
                Physical Sciences (Physics and Chemistry), and Accounting.</p>
