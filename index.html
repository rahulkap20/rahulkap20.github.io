            <h3><a href="https://www.bbdsoftware.com/" target="_blank">BBD</a> (Jan 2023 – Present)</h3>
            <p>BBD is a global software development company with clients in logistics, finance, insurance, and
                telecommunications. With offices in South Africa, the Netherlands, the UK, India, and Portugal, BBD
                delivers full-stack solutions at enterprise scale.</p>

            <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
            <p>January 2024 – Present</p>
            <p>Currently leading development on a logistics management platform for a client operating across multiple
                physical sites. Key responsibilities include maintaining and enhancing a full-stack solution comprising
                a <strong>TypeScript/Angular</strong> frontend, a <strong>.NET/C#</strong> backend, and a
                <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong> database hosted on the <strong>AWS cloud</strong>. Additionally, I
                manage a <strong>WPF desktop application</strong> used at client sites for seamless integration with
                logistics operations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved frontend performance by <strong>20%</strong> and database efficiency by
                    <strong>15%</strong>.</li>
                <li>Reduced client onboarding time by <strong>50%</strong> through process automation.</li>
                <li>Optimized AWS infrastructure, reducing monthly cloud costs by <strong>~30%</strong>.</li>
                <li>Proposed and delivered multiple POCs, each adopted and deployed to production.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I also worked on a large-scale case management system where I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated the release notes process, saving <strong>~5 hours per week</strong>.</li>
                <li>Improved workflow stability and reduced operational error rates by <strong>10%</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In September 2024, I presented at the <strong>Escape technology conference</strong>, one of South
                Africa's largest tech events. My talk, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qkXjN-9QDY"
                    target="_blank">Evolutionary Engineering: Optimising Software Projects with Genetic Algorithms</a>,
                explored the use of genetic algorithms to optimize software timelines and cost planning.</p>

                    target="_blank">University of
                    Pretoria</a></h4>
            <p>Class of 2023</p>
            <p>My master's degree focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AL/ML). I authored a
                dissertation where I made use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and
                Generic Programming (GP) to automate the design process of a convolutional neural network (CNN).
                Additionally, I introduced a variant of Genetic Programming known as Structure-based Genetic Programming
                (SBGP), which proved to be more effective for the same task, surpassing both GAs and traditional GP.
                Fortunately, this research led to the publication of one conference paper and one journal article. I owe
                much of my success to my supervisor, Prof. Nelishia Pillay, whose invaluable guidance contributed
                significantly to achieving these results. Prof. Pillay also co-authored the paper and article: </p>

            <p>Class of 2021</p>
            <p>My honour's degree served to consolidate and enhance my foundational knowledge in computer science and
                software engineering acquired during my undergraduate studies. The subjects I pursued included
                Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing, Data Mining, Digital Forensics, and Computer and Information
                Security. As part of the curriculum, I undertook a research project from a range of topics. I researched
                machine translation using transformer models, focusing on developing a miniature translation program
                capable of translating English into Afrikaans and isiZulu. This involved making use of publicly
                accessible parallel corpora (datasets) to train the translation program.</p>

            <h4><b>BSc Computer Science</b>, University of Pretoria</h4>
            <p>Class of 2020</p>
            <p>During my undergraduate degree, I had the privilege of learning a multitude of skills and techniques from
                exceptionally smart teachers. In my final year, I took subjects such as Software Engineering,
                Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks, and Database Systems. Additionally, I focused on analytical
                subjects like Stochastic Processes, Multivariate Analysis, and Time-Series Analysis. </p>
            <p>As part of my degree requirements, I undertook a final year project that required me, as part of a team,
                to build a piece of software for a corporate client. I was the team leader, and together, my team and I
                built a web application using Reinforcement Learning (an AI technique that allows a program to adjust
                its parameters over time given new information, i.e., learn over time) to control traffic lights in a
                simulated environment. This environment was based on a real stretch of road with multiple intersections.
                Data, such as car numbers, car types, and frequency of cars during regular vs. peak hours, was collected
                for initial training and randomly generated thereafter. This application, called LightBot, was
                well-received by our lecturers, earning me a distinction for the course.</p>

            <p>In my earlier
                years, I concentrated on core computer science principles such as data structures and algorithms,
                concurrent programming, and computer organization and architecture, which provided me with a solid
                foundation. In my first year, I also took physics and business management as minors.</p>

            <p>Class of 2015</p>
            <p>I graduated from high school with seven distinctions and received academic honors in my final year. I
                took the following subjects in high school: English Home Language, Afrikaans First Additional Language,
                Mathematics, AP Mathematics, Information Technology (Computer Programming), Life Sciences (Biology),
                Physical Sciences (Physics and Chemistry), and Accounting.</p>
